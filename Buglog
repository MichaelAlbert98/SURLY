1.) line 97 of Where.java. Need to check if temp+4 is ";" to end the loop.
Otherwise run risk of user inputting a ";" 4 tokens afterwards and ruining the select/delete.

3.) Check if something is temp or not before deleting/inserting/destroying.

4.) Check if temp relation name already exists in database. If so, disallow it. (New constant message?)

5.) Make sure that actual relations can overwrite temp relations. (Possible with current framework?)
