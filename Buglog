1.) line 97 of Where.java. Need to check if temp+4 is ";" to end the loop.
Otherwise run risk of user inputting a ";" 4 tokens afterwards and ruining the select/delete.

2.) Do more testing with selecting/deleting from relations. May still be possible to break.

3.) FOR GOD'S SAKE, check if something is temp or not before deleting/inserting/destroying.

4.) Check if temp relation name already exists in database. If so, disallow it. (New constant message?)

5.) Make sure that actual relations can overwrite temp relations. (Possible with current framework?)

6.) Test if queries on temp relations work.
