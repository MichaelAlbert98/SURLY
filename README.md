# CSCI330Assignment1

This is the implementation of a Lexical Analyzer that can parse and recognize the commands specified in a given input file. Currently, the Lexical Analyzer can recognize the commands 'RELATION', 'INSERT', and 'PRINT' and
determine whether or not the syntax following them is correct. Should the syntax not be correct, a message which
attempts to determine the problem is printed to the terminal and the program continues running through the
remaining commands.

To run, compile the .java files and then run Main.java using the file name with extension as the run argument.
